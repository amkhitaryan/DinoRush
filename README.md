# Dino Rush
A game made for [Ludum Dare 54](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/jurassic-escape) with theme Limited Space in 48 hours. Originally was named **Jurassic Escape**.

Later I decided to finish the game and publish it on steam and changed the name to **Dino Rush**.
### Currently the game has a [steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2811700/Dino_Rush/) (Early Access) and is under development.
